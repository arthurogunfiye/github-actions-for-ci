# GitHub Actions can run multiple workflows for different event triggers.
# Events that trigger workflows - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows
# an action can be added that adds a label to any PR after a preset number of approvals
# These labels act as a visual indicator that something is ready to be merged or use other actions to automatically merge PRs when approved.
